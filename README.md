[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Build Project
- To run and build project run command `flutter build <device-name>`
- To get devices list, run `flutter devices`

## Learning
Few things I have used that you can work to understand flutter development.
- Cross Platform app using Flutter

You can build your own project on this just by changing dart code in `lib` folder.
